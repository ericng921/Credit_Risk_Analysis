# Credit_Risk_Analysis




## Overview of analysis

We obtained a Supervised Learning (with labeled outcome) dataset from LendingClub about credit card credit information. The data in the dataset are imbalanced classification.

The purpose of the analysis is to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced data and to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk. We will apply these techniques to balance out the classifications and improve accuracy score.

There are 6 techniques that we have used which are RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
